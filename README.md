# TOBJ Creator
TOBJ Creator is a Python program that makes TOBJ files for ETS2, ATS and probably every other SCS game.

## Usage
To use the program you will need a base TOBJ file. What that means is that you have to find a TOBJ file created by SCS, e.g. if you're making a recolor of anti_noise6 you can use anti_noise6.tobj as a base. The rest should be pretty self-explanatory. Download the latest release, double click the tobjcreator.py file within the src folder and follow the instructions given in the program. If all goes well, you should have an export.tobj file in the src folder.
